    "| Bulk carrier | A ship which is intended primarily to carry dry cargo in bulk, including such types as ore carriers. |\n",
    "| Chemical tanker | A chemical tanker is a type of tanker ship designed to transport chemicals in bulk. As well as industrial chemicals and clean petroleum products, such ships also often carry other types of sensitive cargo which require a high standard of tank cleaning, such as palm oil, vegetable oils, tallow, caustic soda, and methanol. |\n",
    "| Combination carrier | A ship designed to load 100% deadweight with both liquid and dry cargo in bulk. |\n",
    "| Container ship | A ship designed exclusively for the carriage of containers in holds and on deck. |\n",
    "| Container/ro-ro cargo ship | A ship that can take a combination of containers and ro-ro cargo |\n",
    "| Gas carrier | A cargo ship constructed or adapted and used for the carriage in bulk of any liquefied gas. |\n",
    "| General cargo ship | A ship with a multi-deck or single deck hull designed primarily for the carriage of general cargo. |\n",
    "| LNG carrier | An LNG carrier is a tank ship designed for transporting liquefied natural gas. |\n",
    "| Oil tanker | An oil tanker, also known as a petroleum tanker, is a ship designed for the bulk transport of oil or its products. |\n",
    "| Other ship types |  |\n",
    "| Passenger ship | A passenger ship is a merchant ship whose primary function is to carry passengers on the sea. The category does not include cargo vessels which have accommodations for limited numbers of passengers. |\n",
    "| Refrigerated cargo carrier | A ship designed exclusively for the carriage of refrigerated cargoes in holds. |\n",
    "| Ro-pax ship | The acronym ROPAX (roll-on/roll-off passenger) describes a RORO vessel built for freight vehicle transport along with passenger accommodation. |\n",
    "| Ro-ro ship | Roll-on/roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) ships are cargo ships designed to carry wheeled cargo, such as cars, motorcycles, trucks, semi-trailer trucks, buses, trailers, and railroad cars, that are driven on and off the ship on their own wheels or using a platform vehicle. |\n",
    "| Vehicle carrier | A multi deck roll-on-roll-off cargo ship designed for the carriage of empty cars and trucks |"

    "It can be seen that there is a strong relationship between ship size and efficiency. When considering the $log_{2}$ of deadweight and efficiency value, the relationship between the two appears to be quite linear and is present across all ship types. Of all the ship types, _Refrigerated cargo carrier_ type vessels yield the least improvement in efficiency for an increases in size. This is likely due to the additional power required for the refrigeration which may not benefit from increases in size to the same degree. It is also clear that _Bulk carrier_, _Container ship_, _Container/ro-ro cargo ship_, _Gas carrier_, _General cargo ship_, _Oil tanker_ and _Passenger ship_ type have the next weakest efficiency improvements with size. It is likely that these ships are already significantly larger than other ship types. If so, this would suggest that whilst the relationship appears linear, it is possible to reach a state of diminishing returns for the largest of vessels. The distrubtion of size of ships for each ship type shall be investigated as a follow up on this."

    "It can be seen that across almost all the ship types, the EIV tends to overestimate the technical efficiency values which may be incorrectly suggesting that these vessels are less efficient than they are. Depending on the impact that the technical efficiency values have, it may be worthwhile allocating additional resources to ensure that a vessel's technical efficiency values are calculated using EEDI, not EIV. For example, if adding 10,000 USD of data gathering tools and sensors to a ship would allow EEDI to be used instead of EIV, and that efficiency value would reduce and save more than 10,000 USD over its lifetime then this would be commercially beneficial.\n",
