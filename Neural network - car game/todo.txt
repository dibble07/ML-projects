environment features/physics:
car collisions?
multiple cars - need to move replay buffer and sampling inside agent
turning head/sensor array

race car/driver differences:
sensing array - no, distribution, movement
car parameters - weight, grip, turning radius, acceleration, top speed
exploration vs exploitation
memory - amount and distribution
architecture
rewards weights - emphasis completing laps vs staying on track

tactical additions?
remaining laps
tyre degradation
fuel use
