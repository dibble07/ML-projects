to do:
visulise stats - speed, grip, long force, steering angle
configure reward weights

environment features/physics:
turning head/sensor array
multiple cars
make car an object
need to move replay buffer and sampling inside agent

race car/driver differences:
sensing array - number, distribution, movement
car parameters - weight, grip, turning radius, acceleration, top speed
learning rate - tau
memory - amount and distribution
NN architecture
rewards weights - emphasis completing laps vs staying on track

tactical additions:
remaining laps
tyre degradation
fuel use
