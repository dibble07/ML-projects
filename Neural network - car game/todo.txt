to do:
overcome the boring areas trap

environment features/physics:
multiple cars
	make car an object
	need to move replay buffer and sampling inside agent

race car/driver differences:
sensing array - number, distribution, movement
car parameters - weight, grip, turning radius, acceleration, top speed
learning rate - tau
memory - amount and distribution
NN architecture
rewards weights - emphasis completing laps vs staying on track

tactical additions:
remaining laps
tyre degradation
fuel use
