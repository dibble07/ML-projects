to do:
overcome the boring areas trap - Adaptive Symmetric Noise Rewarding
write own  actor critic
hyper parameter tuning

environment features/physics:
add noise to sensing and actions
heat turning
multiple cars
	make car an object
	need to move replay buffer and sampling inside agent
	move agent to car object

race car/driver differences:
sensing array - number, distribution, movement, noise
car parameters - weight, grip, turning radius, acceleration, top speed, action noise
learning rate - tau
memory - amount and distribution
NN architecture
rewards weights - emphasis completing laps vs staying on track

tactical additions:
remaining laps
tyre degradation
fuel use
