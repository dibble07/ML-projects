tf2rl:
understand options
refine grip useage in environment
simplify tf2rl - maintinaing DQN/DDPG with options

misc:
plot text of score in centre
visualise memory locations
add repeated episilon spikes


environment features/physics:
accelerate and corner at the same time limit by grip
car collisions?
turning head/sensor array

race car/driver differences:
sensing array - no, distribution, movement
car parameters - weight, grip, turning radius, acceleration, top speed
exploration vs exploitation
memory - amount and distribution
architecture
rewards weights - emphasis completing laps vs staying on track

tactical additions?
remaining laps
tyre degradation
fuel use
