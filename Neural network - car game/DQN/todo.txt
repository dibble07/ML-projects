learning:
learn to do lap - maybe breakdown into learning skills
Add all action options - initiate from previous best
learn to do lap fast
multiple frames to learn time derivatives

physics:
acceleration
turning radius
grip limits
tyre degradation
fuel use
remaining laps
race driver differences - sensing array, exploration, memory
turning head/sesnsor array
